			ideas with an exceptionally engaged audience. But during the Covid-19
			pandemic, 92NY&rsquo;s reach has extended far beyond New York &mdash; we
			have emerged as a global institution. Our talks and other events were
			viewed by 4.6 million people in over 200 countries last year. We now
			connect with audiences all over the world.

			We regularly host a diverse array of world leaders, film and entertainment
			artists, Supreme Court Justices, and the sharpest minds in politics and
			literature. Our guests have included President Bill Clinton, Senator
			Kristin Gillibrand, Senator Cory Booker, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Maya
			Angelou, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Robert Caro, Ken Burns, Meryl
			Streep, Shimon Peres, Justice Stephen Breyer, Stacey Abrams, and many
			more.
